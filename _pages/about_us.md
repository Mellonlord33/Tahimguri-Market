Founded by myself to help not just my products but other products throughout Raiyuna to have an easier time getting customers in and products out. My own store and partner businesses promise good quality at a affordable price alongside being easy to access. No inactive stores, no hoping for the auction system to work that day, and no wandering around stoneworks trying to find our chest shops ( *Unless you're into that, at which point we still provide that experience ;)* ).

Partner Store information can be found under each of their individual pages found [here](/items_sold/) respectively. As for my main store, that can be found in the claim "Tahimaguri" on Eldham, located in the mountains of Tetszo, a province apart of Ashai. Below are usernames, coords and contact info you can use if you wish to contact us directly. 

Feel free to drop by as we do sell some commonly brought wares directly via **chest shop** such as pots and common brews. Check out more products from other local businesses as well by clicking on the **Discord** icon on the bottom of the page.
