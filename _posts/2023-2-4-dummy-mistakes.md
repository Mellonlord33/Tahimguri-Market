For Customers attempting to go to /la spawn Tahimaguri to buy pots directly via the chest shop these last few weeks, I am sorry for the inconvenience / accidential lie. I did not realize that the /la spawn was closed to visitors, fear not however as this has been rectified. If you notice any other similar issues please dm me and I will work to fix it as soon as possible to the best of my ability! Thank you all for your patience.
