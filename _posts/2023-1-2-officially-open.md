The Tahimguri Marketplace is now officially open with all preparations and arrangements made to start selling products wrapped up! A few feature changes for the few testers who've used the store are as follows:

- Removed Search Feature due to it seeming to be both cumbersome and unneeded for how large the site is, might re-add if it ever expands, for now it is dead.
- Fixed up some UI issues with store, did not add a review system as moderation seems rather difficult to really handle, especially if someone decided to throw a bot at it. While I could spend more time getting something made, at the end of the day its a block game and there's only so much effort I wish to put into this site.
- Fleshed out in-game store, now stocked up with some basic items I figure people will be interested in buying. Will see down the road.

For now not going to touch the site too much, some planned features are to give the homepage some ompf beyond just a update board as well as possibly get some partner stores up here ( *If you're interested let me know as well ;)* )

Once the site is really cooking, the posts section I plan to use to announce sales, new partner stores, and other updates.
