Welcome to the Tahimguri Brewery Webst- I mean 'Orb'-store, yeah... It is still under heavy development but moving quite along. Due to it still being a work in progress with price tweaking, UI changes and so on this will be a sort of "soft start" until its ready for full release. With that being said, all prices and forms found on the site are up to date and can be used to place down orders, however don't be surprised by heavy price fluctuations as we still get our feet onto the ground. Current features in development that you might be interested in are as follows:

- A in-game chest shop location to buy some commonly purchased items.
- A on-site review system, may or may not be implemented depending on moderation software currently being tested.
- Minor tweaks to UI and Bug Fixes (especially around search function).
